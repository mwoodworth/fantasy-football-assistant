# ESPN Integration with Existing Features Plan

## Current Architecture Issues

### 1. **Duplicate Data Models**
- `League` (generic) vs `ESPNLeague` (ESPN-specific)
- `FantasyTeam` (generic) vs ESPN team data in ESPNLeague
- No data synchronization between systems

### 2. **Feature Isolation**
- ESPN draft assistant works independently
- Dashboard uses mock data instead of ESPN data
- Teams page doesn't show ESPN teams
- AI assistant doesn't access ESPN league data

### 3. **User Experience Problems**
- Users must manage two separate team/league systems
- Dashboard doesn't reflect actual ESPN league status
- No unified view of all fantasy assets

## Integration Solutions

### Phase 1: Data Bridge (Immediate)
Create services to sync ESPN data with existing models

```python
# src/services/espn_bridge.py
class ESPNBridgeService:
    async def sync_espn_to_fantasy_league(self, espn_league: ESPNLeague) -> League:
        """Convert ESPN league to generic league model"""
        
    async def sync_espn_teams_to_fantasy_teams(self, espn_league: ESPNLeague) -> List[FantasyTeam]:
        """Create FantasyTeam records from ESPN league data"""
        
    async def update_dashboard_from_espn(self, user_id: int) -> DashboardData:
        """Generate dashboard data from ESPN leagues"""
```

### Phase 2: Unified Models (Medium-term)
Extend existing models to support ESPN integration

```python
# Enhanced League model
class League(Base):
    # Add ESPN integration fields
    espn_league_id = Column(Integer)
    espn_season = Column(Integer)
    platform_data = Column(JSON)  # Store platform-specific data
    
    def get_platform_league(self) -> Optional[ESPNLeague]:
        """Get ESPN-specific league data if available"""
```

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Long-term)
Connect all features to work with ESPN data

## Detailed Integration Points

### A. Dashboard Integration
**Current**: Mock data only
**Target**: Real ESPN league data

```python
# src/api/dashboard.py - Enhanced
@router.get("/dashboard")
async def get_dashboard(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)):
    # Get user's ESPN leagues
    espn_leagues = get_user_espn_leagues(current_user.id)
    
    # Aggregate data from all leagues
    dashboard_data = await espn_bridge.generate_dashboard_from_espn(espn_leagues)
    
    return dashboard_data
```

**Features to integrate**:
- Team rankings from ESPN leagues
- Live scores from ESPN games
- Injury reports for ESPN roster players
- Waiver targets based on ESPN league settings

### B. Teams Page Integration
**Current**: Mock team data
**Target**: Show ESPN teams alongside generic teams

```typescript
// Frontend teams page enhancement
interface TeamData {
  id: string
  name: string
  league: string
  platform: 'ESPN' | 'Yahoo' | 'Manual'
  espnLeagueId?: number
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**Features to add**:
- Toggle between ESPN and manual teams
- Live roster sync from ESPN
- Starting lineup recommendations
- Trade analysis within ESPN leagues

### C. AI Assistant Integration
**Current**: Generic fantasy advice
**Target**: ESPN league-specific recommendations

```python
# Enhanced AI context with ESPN data
async def get_ai_context(user_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    context = {
        "espn_leagues": await get_user_espn_leagues(user_id),
        "current_rosters": await get_espn_rosters(user_id),
        "league_scoring": await get_espn_scoring_settings(user_id),
        "upcoming_matchups": await get_espn_matchups(user_id)
    }
    return context
```

### D. Analytics Integration
