## Coding Guidelines

- Do not send mock data on error. Only send mock data when the mock flag is true
- do not return mock data on errors
- use python3 all the time, do not run commands with python

## Package Installation

- When asked to install packages, provide clear step-by-step instructions for the user to follow
- Specify the exact commands needed to install required dependencies
- Recommend using a virtual environment before installing packages
