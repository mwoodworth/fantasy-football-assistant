## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+ (or SQLite for development)
- Anthropic API key (optional, mock responses available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fantasy-football-assistant
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

5. Check dependencies (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Check all dependencies
   ./scripts/check_dependencies.sh
   ```

6. Run the application:

   **Option 1: Use the WebSocket-enabled startup script (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/start_with_websockets.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Check and install missing dependencies
   - Enable WebSocket support if disabled
   - Start both backend and frontend servers
   - Show real-time status updates
   
   **Option 2: Use the basic startup script**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
   
   **Option 3: Run services manually**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend API with WebSocket support
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 6001
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

7. Access the application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:6001/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:6001/health

### Default Login
For development, you can register a new account or use:
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: TestPassword123!

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues
If WebSocket features aren't working:

1. **Check dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check_dependencies.sh
   ```

2. **Fix npm permissions** (if needed):
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
   ```

3. **Reinstall frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

4. **Use the WebSocket startup script**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/start_with_websockets.py
   ```

### Common Issues
- **"socket.io-client not found"**: Run `cd frontend && npm install socket.io-client`
- **npm permission errors**: Fix with `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`
- **WebSocket not connecting**: Check that backend is running on port 6001
- **Draft updates not real-time**: Ensure WebSocket icon shows green (connected)
